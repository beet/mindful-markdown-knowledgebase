# Resources

I've been toying with the idea of implementing the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), where notes are organised into 4 main folders:

- Projects
- Areas of interest/responsibility
- Resources
- Archive

This template vault already uses [[README - Project notes|projects]], which I'm thinking of consolidating with [[README - Issues|issues]].

I haven't yet seen any need to archive completed projects, as I don't actually use the folders to navigate my notes, I just COMMAND + O and type in the name.

In **Settings -> Files and links**, the folder to create new notes in has been set to the Resources folder.

So when working in project notes etc., or creating a new resource page from from the log in the daily notes, links to new pages like `[[Obsidian]]` when clicked will create a new page in this folder.
