# Mindful Markdown Knowledgebase

**Disclaimer:** I'm by no means an expert, our brains are all different, what works for me may not work for you.

As Chef John would say, it's just a *technique*, not a recipe to follow to the letter.

## Work smarter, not harder

* **DRY:** write once, recall often
* **Context switching:** should be avoided, but is inevitable, so make it less painful
* **Peace of mind!** ðŸ˜€

## The system

* Mindful
* Markdown
* Knowledge Management

### Mindful

Borrows elements of reflection and review from **Bullet Journalling**

* Less about doing more things
* More about being more effective
* Paradoxically, gets more done

#### Slow is the new fast

> Occasionally you need to waste time for a while to be able to spend it better later. If youâ€™re constantly busy, busy, busy, you donâ€™t have any headspace to reflect on where every daily step is ultimately leading you. Running real fast is no good if itâ€™s into a brick wall.

DHH, [Getting less done](https://m.signalvnoise.com/getting-less-done/)

## Markdown

Plain-text in all the places, forever

* Unstructured data accommodates any system
* Portable, extensible
* Timeless

## Knowledge management

A system for _finding_ information, not just filing it away.

> The mind is for having ideas, not holding them

David Allen, creator of Getting Things Done (GTD)

### Pareto's principle

The 20% of things I need to refer to regularly to do 80% of my work.

## The Process

![[Plan Act Log Reflect(2).png]]

### Reflect & plan

Borrows elements from research logbooks

* Driven by logbook
* Weekly & monthly reviews
* Sets goals for each week/month

> There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all

Peter Drucker

### Act & log

* **Logbook:** an entry for each thing worked on each day
* **Project pages:** a page for each thing being worked on
* **Knowledge pages:** a page for anything I need to refer back to more than once

> The only difference between science, and screwing around, is writing things down

Adam Savage, on the origin of "I reject your reality, and substitute my own"

## The logbook

* Headings for year, month, and day
* Actions like "pick up", "push on", "merge in", "paired up"
* Links to pages for each thing

## Notes

All the things appear to be broken, need to fix them ASAP.

## 2021-02-22 - Digging deeper

Started looking into which things are broken,
confirmed that it's not all of them.
```

## Knowledge pages

* A page for each atomic unit of knowledge
* Back-links between related pages


> Had to `[[Restore sanitised DB snapshot]]` then sort out `[[Sorbet]]` and move on to `[[Deploying test sites]]`
