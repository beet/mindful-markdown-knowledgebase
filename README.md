# Mindful Markdown Knowledgebase

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) template vault designed to provide a task management and Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system that draws inspiration from the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) method and [research logbooks](https://www.hfstevance.com/blog/logbooks).

## Quick start

Clone this repo into a local dir:

```
git clone git@github.com:beet/mindful-markdown-knowledgebase.git
```

- Open as a vault in Obsidian
  - Will probably need to enable community plugins and make sure the selected plugins are all installed
  - The system makes extensive use of the Calendar, Periodic Notes, Templater, and the almighty Tasks plugins. 
- After enabling the Daily Notes plugin, go to today's daily note, and it should be populated from a template

## Working with daily notes

Daily logging is central to this system, and draws inspiration from [A Guide To Research Logbooks â€” Heloise F. Stevance](https://www.hfstevance.com/blog/logbooks).

It begins with the core **Daily Notes** plugin, and relies heavily on the **[Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)** plugin to provide weekly, monthly, and yearly notes, with the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin populating notes from templates as they are created automatically on the fly.

Navigating to today's [[README - Daily notes|daily note]] with a hotkey like COMMAND/CONTROL+T or the sidebar calendar will create a new daily note under the `Daily notes/` folder, that will be pre-populated with content from a template:

* Navigation links to the prev/next daily note
* Tasks due/completed today
* Overdue tasks
* Upcoming tasks this week
* This week's goals
* Today's tasks
* Today's **log**

Having a chronological log of past work helps me practice the [Bullet Journal Method](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book):

> Track the past,
> Order the present,
> Design the future

This is achieved by logging the high-level projects & goals that I'm working on from moment-to-moment and day-to-day, reflecting on what I achieved from one week to the next, and from each month to the next, and steering them with purpose towards long-term goals.

### Daily logging

As I move from one task to the next throughout the day, I create a new bullet point in the **Log** section at the bottom of today's daily note with a link to a project page or meeting note using action verbs like "Picking up", "Pushing on with", "Closing in", etc such as:

```markdown
* Wrapping up [[Project - Garden maintenance June 2023]]
* Picking up [[Project - Mindful Markdown Knowledgebase]]
* Updating [[Homebrew]]
* Merging in [[Ticket - All the bugs]]
* [[Meeting notes/Meeting 2024-03-09 - Sprint planning|Meeting 2024-03-09 - Sprint planning]]
```

This helps pick up where I left off, and also drives the weekly review.

## Weekly review

On the first day of each week, I conduct a review of the previous week where I reflect on the work achieved, review any outstanding tasks, and in BuJu fashion re-schedule any that are still relevant, or cancel any that are not.

To conduct a [[README - Weekly reviews|weekly review]]:

- Open today's daily note, and Insert the "Logbook template - new weekly review link" template into the log section
- Open the inserted link in a new tab, and follow the instructions
- The weekly review page includes a link to create a weekly note page, where I set goals for the week which will automatically appear in daily notes for that week

### Weekly notes

The [[README - Weekly notes|weekly notes]] are where I set high-level goals for the week. The weekly goals appear in the dashboard for each daily note of that week, and are aggregated into the monthly notes page for a future log of upcoming intentions.

It shows any tasks scheduled for the week, and the monthly goals from the monthly notes page.

## Monthly review

On the first day of each month, the first thing I do is conduct a [[README - Monthly reviews|monthly review]] of the previous month. When the first day of the month corresponds with the first day of the week, I'll complete the weekly review first.

Monthly reviews are really an opportunity to aggregate the weekly reviews together into flat lists that give a good bird's eye view of where time and energy went.

To start a monthly review:

- Insert the "Logbook template - new monthly review link" template
- Open the link in a new tab, and follow the instructions
- Each monthly review is for the *previous* month, so the July monthly review would contain the June log entries
- The monthly review pages includes a link to create a [[README - Monthly notes|monthly note]] page where I set goals for the month which will apppear in weekly notes for that month

### Monthly notes

The [[README - Monthly notes|monthly notes]] page is where I set high-level goals for the month, which are aggregated into the yearly notes page.

It shows all scheduled tasks for the month, and aggregates the weekly goals into a future log of intentions.

## Yearly review

- Can start a new [[README - Yearly reviews|yearly review]] by inserting the "Logbook template - new yearly review" template into the logbook
* Open the link in a new tab, and follow the instructions there
* It includes a link to create a [[README - Yearly notes|yearly note]], with a section to set goals for the year, and a future log that aggregates goals from the year's monthly notes

### Yealy notes

The [[README - Yearly notes|yearly notes]] provide a section to intentionally plan to do more of the things that elicited a positive response from the previous year, and less of the things that were negative.

It also creates a **future log** that aggregates the goals from the monthly notes for the year.

## Working with tasks

The mighty [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin provides the basis for managing tasks.

### Tasks in daily notes

Any todo in a daily note is scheduled on that day, and will appear in the various tasks lists.

- The [[README - Daily notes|daily note template]] shows all tasks from all pages that are due on that day
- It also shows any tasks that are overdue, so you never have to worry about forgetting anything

You can actually add a due date to a task in a daily note to schedule it on a different date.

### Tasks in project pages

The [[README - Project notes|project notes template]]  has a section at the top that shows all tasks that are due today and overdue from anywhere on that page.

It provides a **Next actions** section for defining high-level tasks to move the project forward, which can be given a date when time sensitive.

I quite often create low-level ad-hoc todo lists as I'm working, which can also be given due dates as needed.

Any tasks in any project page with a due date will appear in the daily note for that day.

### Tasks in meeting notes

The Tasks plugin has the option to [use the filename as the scheduled date for undated tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Use+Filename+as+Default+Date), which when enabled means that any tasks added to meeting notes, which follow the filename convention of "Meeting YYYY-MM-DD - Title", will automatically appear in the daily note for that date.

This allows for rapid logging of action items during meetings, with confidence that they will float up in the daily notes and not be forgotten.

## Project pages

- [ ] TODO: create a `Projects/` folder with a default template, so you can just create new notes in there and have them populated automatically
  - Template for inserting links to the logbook
* Links to resources, like Github issue, related knowledge pages
* Their own detailed logbook
* Next actions at top
* Detailed notes separated by data
* Screenshots, code snippets, links, etc.
