# Daily notes

> [!Note]
> * To quickly capture something that needs to be done today, hit `COMMAND + T` and add a task to the daily note
> * When navigating back to the [[Logbook]], it will appear at the top under **Today**

Daily notes can be accessed quickly from anywhere with the hotkey `COMMAND + T`, or by clicking on a date in the calendar.

They will be created from the [[Templater]] template [[Daily note template]], which by default aggregates all tasks that are due/overdue on that date from all notes..

This includes any task with an explicit due date from another note, or tasks without an explicit due date in a note with the day's date in its filename, such as `Meeting 2023-06-30` when viewing the daily note for 2023-06-30.

- **TIP:** as I read through news articles on Feedly, if I find something interesting/actionable I share it to Obsidian and append it to today's daily note, then convert that line into a task with an icon in the mobile toolbar. I know it will show up in my [[Dashboard]] at the top of the [[Logbook]] and never drop off my radar.
## Journalling

I have a vault syncing to an Onyx BOOX Android e-reader where I journal in the evenings by simply adding a H2 to the end of the daily note and adding the journal entry after that.
