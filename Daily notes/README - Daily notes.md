# Daily notes

> [!Note] Tip
> * To quickly capture something that needs to be done today, hit `COMMAND + T` and add a task to the daily note

Daily notes can be accessed quickly from anywhere with the hotkey `COMMAND + T`, or by clicking on a date in the calendar.

They will be created from the Templater template [[Daily note template]], which by default aggregates all tasks that are due/overdue on that date from all notes..

This includes any task with an explicit due date from another note, or tasks without an explicit due date in a note with the day's date in its filename, such as `Meeting 2023-06-30` when viewing the daily note for 2023-06-30.

## Overdue

No task from a daily note, or a project page with a due date, will drop off your radar if not completed, but will appear in the overdue section on each day's daily note until completed, cancelled, or re-scheduled.

## Upcoming

These are tasks that are scheduled for today's calendar week as a reminder of what's coming up.

## Weekly goals

These are set during the [[README - Weekly reviews|weekly review]] process in the weekly note as a reminder each day of intent for the week.

## Tasks

This is the section to add tasks which will be assigned a due date for the calendar day.

## Log

While working throughout the day, at a bullet point with a link to a project page. These serve as a reminder of what you were doing, and are the basis of the [[README - Weekly reviews|weekly review]] process.
