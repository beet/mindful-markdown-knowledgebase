# Weekly reviews

> [!Note]
> * Weekly reviews are an opportunity to reflect on the previous week's work, re-schedule/cancel open tasks as needed, and plan high-level goals for the coming week.
> * High-level goals for the month should remain largely unchanged from week-to-week

## Process

### Reflect

- Insert a log entry into the log section of today's daily note using the "Logbook template - new weekly review link" template
* Click on the link to create a new, blank weekly review page
  * **TIP:** Hold `OPT + COMMAND` to open it in a new tab group
* It should be automatically populated with the [[Templates/Weekly review template||Weekly review template]]
- Copy the previous week's log entries and paste them into the weekly review page
- Move each bullet point down into the relevant sections from bottom to top

### Plan

- Review the linked pages, and add status tags to them like #DONE, #WIP, #IN-REVIEW  etc.
- Either re-schedule any outstanding tasks that are still relevant, or cancel any that are not
- Take a look at the monthly and yearly notes to see if there are any upcoming dates this week, or any new dates that need to be added
- Flesh out the high-level **goals** for the week as **tasks** in the [[README - Weekly notes|weekly note]]
  - **TIP:** any tasks in weekly notes will appear at the top of that week's daily notes!
