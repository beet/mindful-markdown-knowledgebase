# Monthly reviews

## Process

- Conduct a [[README - Weekly reviews|weekly review]] if the first day of the month is on the first day of the week
- Insert the "Logbook template - new monthly review link" template into the logbook
- Open the link in a new tab which will populate the page from the [[Monthly review template]], and follow the instructions there.

The top of the monthly review will provide links to the weekly reviews for the month. I'll usually open them in a new tab, copy the tasks, meetings, etc. and paste them into the monthly review, them move them down into the corresponding section.

I'll then go through and add tags them like #DONE, #WIP, #BACKLOGGED  etc.

As I do, I'll add key points to the **wins** and **learnings** at the top.

The **Goals** section provides a link to the [[README - Monthly notes|monthly note]], where I'll use the review to set my intentions and check the future log for the month.

I'll then use the link at the top of the monthly note to view the [[README - Yearly notes|yearly note]] and review my high-level goals for the year, reflect on my goals from previous months, and scan ahead through the future log of upcoming dates & goals.
