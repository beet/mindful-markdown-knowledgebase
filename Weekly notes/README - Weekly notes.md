# Weekly notes

Weekly notes primarily serve to capture high-level goals for the week, and also serve as a future log of intentions for the month.

Any task on the weekly note will appear as a weekly goal in the daily notes for the week.

When viewing the [[README - Monthly notes|monthly note]], it aggregates the weekly goals together into a future log of upcoming intentions that is also a central part of the [[README - Weekly reviews|weekly review]] process.

## Weekly goals

Tasks are added here during weekly review to set intentions for the coming week.

During weekly review of the previous week, these can be marked as completed if done, cancelled if no longer relevant, or forwarded if carried across to the current week:

- [x] Be my best self
- [-] Fix all the things
- [>] Complete the long-running project

## This week

These are all tasks from all pages that are due within this calendar week.

## Monthly goals

The monthly goals are set in this month's monthly note, and are displayed in this section for all weekly notes of that month.
