# Yearly reviews

Inspired by [Tim Ferris' Past Year Review](https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/), the yearly review page provides links to each monthly review for the year. While reflecting on each monthly review, list the things that were positive, and the things that were negative.

The powerful thing about this process is how often the month's that _felt_ quite negative, were actually full of many positive things, and only one or two negative things.

## Goals

The goals section provides a link to the [[README - Yearly notes|yearly note]], where I set high-level intentions for the year, and consciously plan to do more of the positive things, and less of the negative things, within my sphere of control.
