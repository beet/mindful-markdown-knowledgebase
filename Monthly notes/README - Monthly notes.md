# Monthly notes

> [!Tip] Ad-hoc tasks
> * Add a task to the current monthly note, and it will appear as a **monthly goal** on the [[Dashboard]]

I use monthly notes to capture key dates, and plan things to do more/less of based on the previous [[README - Monthly reviews|monthly review]].

A sample monthly note might look like:

```markdown
# June 2023

* **Mon 12:** King's bday

## Do more of

- Take vitamin D suppliments

## Do less of

- Drinking through the dark months of winter

## Goals

- [ ] Go on a sneaky winter hiking camp
```
