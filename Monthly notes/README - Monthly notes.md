# Monthly notes

Monthly notes are usually created as part of the [[README - Monthly reviews|monthly review ]] process, but also serve as a **future log** for upcoming dates, in which case they may be created in advance.

## Monthly goals

Add a few todo's to this section setting a few high-level goals for the month, and any key dates that are coming up.

These will appear in the [[README - Weekly notes|weekly notes]] as a reminder, and are also aggregated into the [[README - Yearly notes|yearly note]] as a bird's eye future log for the entire year.

## This month

Any tasks added to daily notes for the month will appear here.

## Weekly note goals

The monthly note template generates headings for each week of the month, and uses the Tasks plugin to pull in each week's goals as a future log for the month.
